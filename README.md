# NI-SCOPE Soft Front Panel Demo

This is a demo written with the NI-SCOPE python API to demonstrate the newly added measurement library methods.
This demo was written in a couple days using the tkinter framework for the UI, and the tkintertable pip module which implements fancy tables using tkinter.

As of writing this, the niscope module using the measurement library has not been released. You will need to manually build the wheel by building a local download of https://github.com/ni/nimi-python and install that as a local pip module in order to run this demo. When the niscope module is released with these updates, manually built wheels will no longer be necessary.

This code was all written by myself, Shiloh Beeler, and is property of NI as per the license contained within the repo.
